# CrunchyApp
just a sample application on crunchyCalendar library https://github.com/CleverPumpkin/CrunchyCalendar

I am just trying to implement and customize some feature into this crunchy calendar which already has a nice documentation and implementation of its library. 

And also practicing some Kotlin along with it.
