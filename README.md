# CrunchyApp
just a sample application on crunchyCalendar library https://github.com/CleverPumpkin/CrunchyCalendar

I am just trying to implement and customize some feature into this crunchy calendar which already has a nice documentation and implementation of its library. 

Adding the time range picker as well. 

And also practicing some Kotlin along with it as it seems. 

will take time to learn on kotlin as it seems.
